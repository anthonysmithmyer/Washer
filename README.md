# Washer

## Project Summary

The objective of this report was to analyze a disk image of a hard drive belonging to a suspect related to the Mantooth case. Washer required the use of multiple Digital Forensics tools, such as Autopsy, Windows Registry Explorer, Windows Event Viewer, etc. in order to write a report summarizing my findings in a way that could be presented in court to prove the individual committed several crimes and had an association with Mantooth.
